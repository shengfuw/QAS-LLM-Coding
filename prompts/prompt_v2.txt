###Instruction###
I am in the process of coding a set of standardized survey questions to identify any potential issues. The Questionnaire Appraisal System (QAS) will be used to systematically evaluate each survey question for possible problems. I will provide you with each survey question (along with its response categories) one by one. As an expert in survey questionnaires, you have to use the QAS to identify any problems (1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d, 4a, 4b, 4c, 5a, 5b, 5c, 5d, 6a, 6b, 6c, 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d, 7e, 7f, 7g, 8a) in each question and explain the reasons behind these problems.

The QAS includes the following problems (1a.-8a.):
STEP 1 - READING: Determine if it is difficult for interviewers to read the question uniformly to all respondents.
1a. WHAT TO READ: Interviewer may have difficulty determining what parts of the question should be read.
*Indicate 1a if (1)  The interviewer must make a decision as to whether or not to read certain parts of the question to a particular respondent. OR (2) The question contains phrases in parentheses or instructions labeled READ IF NECESSARY. Example: “In the past month, have you talked to a doctor or other health professional about your own health? (READ IF NECESSARY - include doctors, nurses, dentists, psychologists, osteopaths, and chiropractors. Do not include telephone calls only for the purpose of making appointments)”. Comment: How will the interviewer know whether it is necessary to read the question’s additional phrases? If you want all respondents to include or exclude certain things, then the explanatory information must be read to each respondent.

1b. MISSING INFORMATION: Information interviewer needs to administer question is not contained in question.
*Indicate 1b if (1) The interviewer must remember something about the respondent, consult other materials, or return to another question to determine if the question should be asked for that respondent. OR (2) The question depends on information that may not have been collected previously in the interview. Example: “(Ask if age >60): Would you say that your health in general is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” Comment: The interviewer may not know the respondent’s age at this point in the survey. Or, given computer-based administration, even if the computer is taking care of this, we need to at least determine if the appropriate information (here, age) will have been collected previously.

1c. HOW TO READ: Question is not fully scripted and therefore difficult to read.
*Indicate 1c if the wording necessary to read the question is not provided. This frequently occurs when questions are converted from a self-administered method to another method, such as telephone administration, in which the questions are to be read by the interviewer. Example: “How many glasses (8 oz) of milk (whole, 2%, or skim milk) did you drink yesterday?” Comment: It is clear what to read (the parenthetical parts are important), but it is unclear how to read it. The parts in parentheses can easily be read silently, and would be fine for a self-administered questionnaire. However, if read by an interviewer, the question needs to be rephrased as “How many 8 ounce glasses of whole, two-percent, or skim milk did you drink yesterday?”

STEP 2 - INSTRUCTIONS: Look for problems with any introductions, instructions, or explanations from the respondent’s point of view.
2a. CONFLICTING OR INACCURATE INSTRUCTIONS, introductions, or explanations.
*Indicate 2a if an instruction, introduction, or explanation contains conflicting information, or conflicts with the question. Example 1: “The next questions are about the claims process involved with [Health Plan Name]. How would you rate the range of services covered by [Health Plan Name]?” Comment: Here, “claims process” conflicts with “range of services.” It would be better to simply open with “The next questions are about [Health Plan Name]” Example 2: “The next questions are about arthritis. Do you have some form of arthritis, gout, bursitis, tendinitis, or lupus?” Comment: The instruction concerns only “arthritis,” whereas the question asks about a number of items that will not be recognized by most respondents as types of arthritis. The question would be clearer without the introduction.

2b. COMPLICATED INSTRUCTIONS, introductions, or explanations.
*Indicate 2b if the question has extensive instructions that may be difficult for respondents to follow. Example: “Behaviors associated with having the AIDS virus include male homosexual contact, injecting illegal drugs, and sex with multiple partners or a person with any of these risks. In terms of your own risk, what would you say your chances are of having the AIDS virus?” Comment: Respondents generally find it difficult to remember a set of complicated instructions. Moreover, attempting to teach respondents about risk within the question is most likely misguided. If people do not know these things, one sentence in a questionnaire will be unlikely to inform them. It would probably be more effective to assess knowledge by asking several questions about factors that influence HIV/AIDS risk before asking about degree of AIDS risk.

STEP 3 - CLARITY: Identify problems related to communicating intent or meaning of question to the respondent.
3a. WORDING: Question is lengthy, awkward, ungrammatical, or contains complicated syntax.
*Indicate 3a if the question contains a large amount of text or uses complex syntax, or the wording could be made more “natural.” Example 1: “Which of the following best describes whether you have a smoke alarm in your home? You own a smoke alarm, and it is installed and working; you own a smoke alarm, but it is broken or not installed; you own a smoke alarm but the battery is missing; you don’t own a smoke alarm because it is too expensive; you don’t own a smoke alarm because you don’t think it is necessary; or you don’t own a smoke alarm for some other reason?” Comment: The problem is self-evident. A good way to identify questions that are excessive in length is to read them out loud, especially to another person. Again, remember especially that telephone administration puts a severe limit on question length. Example 2: “What are the disabilities or health problems of this person?” Comment: It would be better to ask “What disabilities or health problems does this person have?”

3b. TECHNICAL TERM(S) are undefined, unclear, or complex.
*Indicate 3b if the question contains specific technical terms that are undefined or for which simpler alternatives exist. Example: “What kind of doctor treats your diabetes: A general or family practitioner, an internal medicine doctor, a diabetologist, or someone else?” Comment: “Diabetologist” is better conveyed as “a specialist who deals with diabetes”; “practitioner” may be better communicated as “doctor.”

3c. VAGUE: There are multiple ways to interpret the question or to decide what is to be included or excluded.
*Indicate 3c if there are two (or more) possible alternative interpretations and it is unclear which is meant. Example 1: “Have you had your blood tested for the AIDS virus?” Comment: It is unclear whether this means “Did I take the initiative in deciding to have my blood tested?” versus “Was it tested as part of any type of blood test?” Sometimes respondents will say that “I needed it tested for my job—but I didn’t go out of my way to have it done.” If the issue of interest is the act of testing, simply ask “As far as you know, has your blood ever been tested for the AIDS virus?” Example 2: “Do you think that diabetes can cause problems with your kidneys?” Comment: When asked of diabetics, it may not be clear whether this means (a) in general, or (b) does it cause problems for me. If the former is intended, rephrase: “Do you think that diabetes can cause kidney problems?”

Also, indicate 3c if the question contains undefined or unclear common terms. Example 1: “Do you have a car?” Comment: You: Who is “you” — me, or anyone in the household? Have: What does this mean — own? lease? Car: Does this include pickup truck? Van? It is because of these problems that survey questions must be constructed more carefully. An equivalent might be: “Does anyone in your household now own or lease a car, truck, or other type of motor vehicle?” Example 2: “Are there any guns located in your house?” Comment: What type of gun? Does a BB gun count? Where in the house—does the garage count? What if someone is out hunting, as we speak? Example 3: “Does your local health department provide any public health services?” Comment: What is a “public health service”? Will members of the public have any idea what we mean? The question needs to either provide a definition, or else ask separately about a range of specific services.

Also, indicate 3c if it is unclear what is to be included and excluded from the question. Example 1: “How often do you take part in community organizations, meetings, or other activities involving Hispanic people or culture?” Comment: What is to be included here? If I have a meeting at work with two people who happen to be Hispanic, does that count? For this question to work as it is (probably) intended, it would need to ask specifically about “activities that focus on Hispanic culture or people of Hispanic origin.” Example 2: “In the past 12 months, have you talked to a doctor or other health professional?” Comment: Do phone calls to make appointments count? Do visits for children count? What counts as a “health professional”? Does a visit to an acupuncturist count? To be thorough, the question might ask about a series of health professionals. At the least, it can be improved by indicating what to include or exclude (by adding, for example “Include phone conversations, except if these were only to make appointments”).

Also, indicate 3c if it is unclear what “frame of reference” the respondent is supposed to adopt. This problem is often in evidence if a typical reaction might be “compared to what?” or “compared to whom?” Example: “How much would you say you know about Lyme disease? A lot, some, a little, or nothing?” Comment: This can be difficult to answer because the respondent does not really know to whom they should compare themselves. Although I may have heard of Lyme disease, know that it comes from deer ticks, and know some of the symptoms, that is not a lot compared to, for example, a medical expert. Also, it is premature to ask a detailed question before establishing that the question is relevant. It may be better to first ask: “Have you ever heard of Lyme disease?”

Also, indicate 3c if there is simply not enough information given to prompt a meaningful answer. Example: “Would you support an increase in cigarette taxes if the additional revenue was spent on community cancer prevention and control programs?” Comment: Respondents who smoke, and who are making a serious attempt to answer the question, may object that it does not contain sufficient information. If the increase were a nickel a pack, that may be different than if it were a dollar a pack. The amount needs to be specified. Often, a question having this type of problem naturally elicits a response of “it depends...” (on additional information that is not supplied).

Please note that 3b involves particular technical terms that can be picked out as too complex for the target population.. If there are no such technical terms, but clarity is difficult because of general vagueness of relatively common terms, then choose 3c instead of 3b.

3d. REFERENCE PERIODS are missing, not well specified, or in conflict.
*Indicate 3d when the time period asked about is not clear. Example 1: “Before your last pregnancy, had you stopped using all methods of birth control?” Comment: How long before pregnancy? Do we mean days, months, years, or something else? Depending on the reference period of interest, the question could instead start with: “During the 3 months before that pregnancy...” Example 2: “How many glasses of low-fat or skim milk per day do you usually drink?” Comment: No reference period is indicated. Is this in the past week, past month, past year, or some other period of time? Example 3: “How many times have you visited a dentist during the past year?” Comment: The term “past year” is commonly misunderstood. This may mean “past calendar year,” “since January 1,” or “since 365 days ago.” If the latter is intended, it makes more sense to say “in the past 12 months.” If we are very concerned about this being exactly 12 months, it also helps to indicate the date (...that is, “since May 20, 1999”). Example 4: “Have you ever been examined within the past 12 months by a doctor for skin cancer?” Comment: In this case, the term “ever” implies a lifetime reference period. If the desired reference period is the past 12 months, then “ever” should be removed.

STEP 4 - ASSUMPTIONS: Determine if there are problems with assumptions made or the underlying logic.
4a. INAPPROPRIATE ASSUMPTIONS are made about the respondent or about his/her living situation.
*Indicate 4a if the question contains (often subtle) logical problems, such as those in these examples. Example 1: “How often do you usually select low-salt foods at the grocery store—Most of the time, sometimes, rarely, or never?” Comment: We do not know if the person even goes to the grocery store, so it is hard to interpret a “never” response. To provide the information desired, it is necessary to first ask how often the person shops for food, and if it is never, to skip him or her from the follow-up question. Example 2: “Have you had (medical test X) done? IF YES: When you got your most recent test result, was it positive or negative?” Comment: We have not established that the person received the results of the test. This needs to be asked as a separate question (“Did you receive the results of that test?”), or at least to include a “did not receive the results” response category. Example 3: “How confident are you in your doctor’s ability to help you with your health problems?” Comment: This sounds simple enough, but even assuming we have established already that the person has one main doctor who he/she has visited recently, it ignores the fact that some people may go to that doctor only for screening and general checkups and may not have any health problems. Again, this would serve best as a follow-up to an initial question, such as: “In the past 12 months, have you visited that doctor to get treatment for any health problem, or only for general care and routine checkups?” Example 4: “Have you ever had an amputation? IF YES: What extremity was amputated? _Toe _Foot _Leg _Arm _Finger” Comment: It is possible that may have been multiple amputations. If a questionnaire data coding system is set up to allow only one response, this will cause problems.

4b. ASSUMES CONSTANT BEHAVIOR or experience for situations that vary.
*Indicate 4b if the behavior or experience is typically irregular rather than constant in nature, and the question forces an average or typical value that may be difficult or not meaningful. If the answer is likely to be “it varies...,” then this problem exists. Example 1: “How often does your arthritis prevent you from doing your usual work or taking part in social activities? Would you say every day, almost every day, once a week, occasionally, or never?” Comment: Note that flare-ups are a common characteristic of many chronic medical conditions. Respondents tend to say that there are weeks when they cannot do these things at all, and then it gets better again. Although this problem has not been solved by questionnaire designers, it might help to first ask a question about the regularity of the experience. Example 2: “When you go out in the sun for an hour or more, how often do you wear sunscreen or protective clothing?” Comment: In the middle of summer I may be very likely to, but in February, this is extremely unlikely. How should I give an overall judgment? Specifying the season would help somewhat. 

Type 4b, like 4a, involves an inappropriate assumption. The difference is that in 4b the assumption relates not to whether something is true for the respondent (it may well be, to some extent), but rather, whether it is true in the “static” sense that is implied. If the problem relates to variation in some attribute or behavior that the question does not take account of, then select 4b.

4c. DOUBLE-BARRELED: Contains more than one implicit question.
*Indicate 4c if there are two or more questions in one. Example 1: “Are you covered by Medicaid or any type of dental benefits plan?” Comment: Does this mean a Medicaid dental plan? Or any type of Medicaid? This needs to be divided into two separate questions. Example 2: “Do you think that ministers, politicians, and other community leaders should speak out against cigarettes and tobacco?” Comment: This one is actually triple-barreled. One could think that politicians and other community leaders should, but that ministers should not. These could instead be asked about separately (as in a “stem-based” question): Do you think each of the following should speak out against cigarettes and tobacco... Ministers? Politicians? Other community leaders?

STEP 5 - KNOWLEDGE/MEMORY: Check if whether respondents are likely to not know or have trouble remembering information.
5a. KNOWLEDGE may not exist: Respondent is unlikely to know the answer to a factual question.
*Indicate 5a if the question is factual in nature, and it is likely that the respondent simply does not have the knowledge necessary to answer the question, and may never have. Note that this problem is sometimes caused by asking for an excessive level of detail. Example 1: “What kind of calcium pills do you take? (Mark those mentioned) _calcium _carbonate (generic) _Citracal _caltrate _calcium gluconate _Biocal _calcium lactate _Tums _Tums E-X _Oscal 500 _vitamin/mineral supplement _other” Comment: People who regularly take pills often have no idea of precisely what type of pills these are. Solutions may involve reducing the level of specificity, or even re-thinking whether the question can be posed. Logically, if people do not know the answer, we should not be asking the question. Example 2: “Thinking about your most recent mammogram, how much did it cost, regardless of who paid for it? Include just the cost of the x-ray itself and not any fee charged by the doctor at the x-ray facility, or the cost for an office visit where the test was ordered.” Comment: Respondents in a health maintenance organization (HMO) who simply make a co-payment may have no idea how much the mammogram cost. Also, even those who pay out-of-pocket, or according to a fee-for-service model, may have no way of disentangling the cost of the test from the cost of the office visit. Example 3: “Have you been examined within the past year by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional for oral or mouth cancer?” Comment: People often are not aware of what a check for oral or mouth cancer consists of, and especially, whether their dentist has done one.

Also, indicate 5a if there may be a problem that involve a projection or hypothetical situation. Example: “How would you rate your own chances of getting Lyme disease in the coming year—high, medium, low, or none?” Comment: Respondents are often unable to make such judgments. It may be better to simply ask about behaviors which we know increase the chances of getting Lyme disease, or about knowledge concerning how Lyme disease is contracted.

5b. ATTITUDE may not exist: Respondent is unlikely to have formed the attitude being asked about.
*Indicate 5b. if attitudinal questions that ask about issues the respondent may have no opinion on, or given any thought to. Example 1: “Do you think that laws restricting the sale of tobacco products to minors have been adequately enforced?” Comment: This may be very difficult for 65-year-old respondent who does not know any minors, let alone any who smokes. At the least, a question like this needs to explicitly allow respondents to indicate that they have no opinion on the issue (here, by adding: “...or are you not aware of how well these laws have been enforced?”). Example 2: “Do you think that current regulations for mammography equipment and personnel are adequate to insure the safety of women?” Comment: This is clearly well beyond the range of knowledge that exists in most population respondent groups. Example 3: “In general, would you say that your State’s Congressmen are doing a good job, or a bad job?” Comment: Respondents will happily answer this question, even in the absence of knowing who their congressmen are, or anything in particular that they have done. At the least, if there is the likelihood that people may reasonably be expected not to have a true opinion, then they should be allowed to express this, as in “... or do you have no opinion?”

5c. RECALL failure: Respondent may not remember the information asked for.
*Indicate 5c if there is a good chance that a significant segment of the population will no longer remember what we may be interested in asking them. Even if a respondent had learned the relevant information at some point, he/she may no longer remember it because the time interval (the reference period) is too long, or the events are routine or non-memorable. Example 1: “How many mammograms have you had in the past 10 years?” Comment: An exact count for something like this can be difficult. It would be better to present a series of response category ranges (“Would you say none, one, one to five, or more than five?”), to make the task easier. Example 2: “During the past 12 months, how many days did illnesses or injury keep you from working?” Comment: It is very difficult to both (a) remember all occurrences in the past 12 months, and (b) remember to exclude occurrences previous to that. Again, providing response category ranges would facilitate this cognitive task.

How can we distinguish between the case in which the respondent never knew the answer (5a) from when he/she did at one time, but simply cannot remember (5c)? Often, this must be a judgment call, depending on what assumptions we are willing to make about what people are likely to know or now know. One way to think about this issue is to consider whether putting a few “cues” or reminders in the question will help or not— logically, it cannot for 5a problems, but may for those covered by 5c.

5d. COMPUTATION problem: The question requires a difficult mental calculation.
*Indicate 5d if the question simply presents a task that is complex in terms of computational difficulty, as this overloads the person’s working memory. Example: “In a typical workweek, about what proportion of your time is spent on each of the following activities? __ Walking? __ Sitting? __ Standing?” Comment: Answering this question can be very difficult: The respondent must consider the total number of hours worked, the total number of hours devoted to each activity, and then express these as a ratio. Further, without knowing up front how many items in the list, the respondent will have no idea how to allocate these estimates so that they will sum to a meaningful total. It would be better to instead ask about the number of hours per day the person spends on each activity, and then to compute proportions in the analysis.

STEP 6 - SENSITIVITY/BIAS: Assess questions for sensitive nature or wording, and for bias.
6a. SENSITIVE CONTENT (general): The question asks about a topic that is embarrassing, very private, or that involves illegal behavior.
*Indicate 6a if the question asks about sensitive issues or behaviors. Example: “How many different people have you had sex with in the past 12 months?” Comment: Would a person whose spouse might possibly overhear on another extension be willing to give a response other than “one”? Such a question may not be appropriate for a telephone survey, unless special procedures (such as use of touch-tone keying to enter the response) are used.

6b. SENSITIVE WORDING (specific): Given that the general topic is sensitive, the wording should be improved to minimize sensitivity.
*Indicate 6b if the question contains terms that are emotionally loaded, offensive, or that can be stated more “gently.” Example: “In the past 12 months, have you driven when you were drunk?” Comment: The term drunk has negative connotations. It may be better to soften this, as in “...when you may have had too much to drink.” It might be objected that the latter is too vague, but drunk is not much better because respondents will not know whether they were legally intoxicated, or have any other way of better interpreting the intended concept.

6c. SOCIALLY ACCEPTABLE response is implied by the question.
*Indicate 6c if the question contains phrasing or response categories that imply that one answer should be chosen because it is preferable to other alternatives. Example 1: “Did you use condoms as protection to prevent disease?” Comment: This suggests only one use (disease prevention), and it is very easy to say “yes,” even if the real reason was something else (e.g., avoiding pregnancy). If there is a small list of likely candidate reasons, it is best to read them all: “Did you use condoms to avoid pregnancy, to prevent disease, or both?” Example 2: “Do you agree that cigarette smoking can cause cancer?” Comment: It would be much less biased to rephrase, as in: “For the following statements, tell me whether you agree, disagree, or have no opinion. (1) Cigarette smoking can cause cancer.” On an average day, for about how many hours do you watch television? Would you say none, between 1 and 2 hours, 2 to 4 hours, or more than 4 hours? Example 3: “On an average day, for about how many hours do you watch television? Would you say none, between 1 and 2 hours, 2 to 4 hours, or more than 4 hours?” Comment: A great deal of research has shown that the category ranges provided by behavior frequency questions such as this tend to guide the respondent’s choices—changing the nature of these ranges markedly alters response distributions, when certain responses may be seen as more desirable than others. So, especially where there may be some social desirability to the behavior, it is better to ask this simply as an open-ended question and code the response directly.

STEP 7 - RESPONSE CATEGORIES: Assess the adequacy of the range of responses to be recorded.
7a. OPEN-ENDED QUESTION that is inappropriate or difficult.
*For open-ended questions (those for which the response categories are not read to respondent) Indicate 7a if (1) Respondents will have trouble providing an unguided response. OR (2) The answers given by respondents are likely to be difficult for the interviewer to code. Example 1 What prompted you to have your most recent mammogram? (Mark those mentioned) _Doctor recommended _Other health professional recommended _Part of regular checkup _Friend encouraged _Awareness of guidelines/need _Breast problems _Advertisement _Other” Comment: Respondents will have no way of knowing what the intended range of acceptable answers are. Interviewers will also have problems coding the types of answers that respondents tend to give (“Well, it was time to get one done...”; “I was told to”; “I wanted to see if there was a problem”). It is better to let respondents know the acceptable responses by reading these, if the list is not too long. If the list is long, and covers more than one dimension of an issue (such as who indicated the test should be done versus why it should be done), then this can be “decomposed” into multiple questions that are more specific. For example, it might be better to divide this example into two questions. A) Who recommended that you have your most recent mammogram—a doctor, another type of health professional, someone else you know, or did you decide on your own? B) Did you receive this mammogram as part of a regular checkup, because of a breast problem, or for some other reason? Example 2: “People go to the dentist for many reasons. What was the main reason for your last visit? _Emergency _Periodic checkup _Filling _Cleaning _Extraction _Orthodontics _Gum treatment _Denture work _Crown or bridge” Comment: Again, the respondent does not see the available choices. Therefore, he or she may simply say “checkup.” The interviewer has no way of knowing whether this is periodic (the respondent may not have been to the dentist in years, so we cannot assume the regularity of the behavior. At the least, the term periodic should be deleted.

7b. MISMATCH between question and response categories.
*Indicate 7b if the answers presented or implied by the question itself conflict with the response categories. Example 1: “Since you’ve lived in your current residence, have any special locks been installed on the doors of your home? _Yes _No _No opinion” Comment: Note that the response categories implied do not match those that are given to the interviewer to use. This is not, in fact, an opinion question (it is either true or it is not, or the respondent does not know). So, this question should use Don’t know instead of No opinion. Example 2: “Thinking about your last pregnancy—Did you become pregnant sooner than you wanted, later than you wanted, or at the time you wanted to? _Sooner _Later _At the time _Didn’t want pregnancy” Comment: The last category is provided to the interviewer in case it is volunteered, but the respondent does not know this and may get confused and not know to say this. The question should include the phrase “...or didn’t you want to get pregnant at all?” Example 3: “When was your diabetes diagnosed? _Within the past 12 months _Within the past 5 years _More than 5 years ago” Comment: The respondent does not know that the interviewer will be marking only a wide range and so may struggle to remember an exact date, when this is totally unnecessary. It is important to provide, in the question, information about the level of specificity required in the answer: “When was your diabetes diagnosed—Was it within the past 12 months, between 1 and 5 years ago, or more than 5 years ago?” Example 4: “Do you plan to have a mammogram in the future? _Yes - next 12 months _Yes - next 24 months _No” Comment: This is asked as a “yes/no” question, whereas the interviewer is intended to determine when the respondent next intends to have a mammogram. Clearly, the latter concept needs to be asked as a follow-up question: IF YES: “When do you plan to have your next mammogram—in the next 12 months, between 1 and 2 years from now, or more than 2 years from now?”

7c. TECHNICAL TERM(S) are undefined, unclear, or complex.
*See Step 3, Problem 3b, “Question contains undefined, unclear, or complex technical terms.” Note that this problem may have already been “picked up” there if the response categories are read to the respondent. If not, and the question contains response categories with undefined or vague technical terms, indicate 7c.

7d. VAGUE response categories are subject to multiple interpretations.
*See Step 3, Problem 3c, Vague, “There are multiple ways to interpret the question.” Again, note that this problem may have already been detected there, if the response categories are read by the interviewer and are therefore “part of the question.” For cases where the response categories are separate from the question, but display that same type of vagueness, indicate 7d. Example: ”In the past 30 days, how often have you had a headache? [ENTER RESPONSE GIVEN BY RESPONDENT] _Never _Seldom _Occasionally _Frequently” Comment: Besides not working very well as an open-ended question (see Problem Type 7a), there is another problem: People tend to vary with respect to their interpretation of vague terms, such as “seldom” and “occasionally.” One person may consider 3 or 4 headaches as “seldom,” another “occasionally.” Therefore, it would be better to ask for the quantitative frequency with which headaches have occurred: In the past 30 days, how often have you had a headache? Would you say every day, between 3 and 6 times a week, once or twice a week, or less than once a week?

7e. OVERLAPPING response categories.
*Indicate 7e if the response categories are NOT mutually exclusive. Example: “_Strongly agree _Agree _Disagree _Strongly disagree.” Comment: If someone agrees strongly, they also agree. It would be better to add somewhat to the second and third categories here.

7f. MISSING eligible responses in response categories.
*Indicate 7f if there are “gaps” between response categories. “Example 1: _All of the time _Most of the time _Seldom _Never” Comment: Someone who engages in the behavior “sometimes” will have trouble finding a response category that fits. So, “some of the time” should be added. Again, it would be better not to use words like “seldom.” “Always, More than half the time, Half the time, Less than half the time, Never” are good substitutes. Example 2: “Do you consider yourself to be overweight, underweight, or about average?” Comment: Some people may not fit any of the given categories. A National Football League lineman (or a horse race jockey) might consider himself to be none of these things; he is at a desirable weight, but it is not anywhere near average. Instead, use “overweight, underweight, or about the right weight?”

7g. ILLOGICAL ORDER of response categories.
*Indicate 7g if the categories that are read to respondents, or presented for the interviewer to select, are out of order. Example: “Over the past 12 months, about how many sex partners did you have? Would you say only one, two or three, between four and ten, more than ten, or none?” Comment: Because this is an ordered list that increases in magnitude, it sounds strange to place “none” at the end.

STEP 8 - OTHER PROBLEMS: Look for problems not identified in Steps 1 - 7.
8a. Other problems not previously identified.
*Indicate 8a if you do uncover problems not otherwise described by the previous QAS steps and enter a note indicating the nature of the problem found.

Also, note the following: (i) Words in all capital letters indicate instructions for the interviewer and should not be read aloud to respondents. (ii) Response categories or options are presented in one of two formats: either with an underscore (e.g., “_Very likely _Somewhat likely…”) or separated by a pipe within parentheses (e.g., “(Very likely | Somewhat likely | …)”). (iii) If a question includes “[…]”, it indicates that the question belongs to a set (or "battery") of items that share the same response categories and a common introductory question (i.e., preamble). The text within the brackets serves as the preamble for the battery, followed by individual items/questions.

###Example###
A survey question I will give you will look like this: 
q3_full "If a medical researcher asked you to participate in a medical research study by giving a sample of your blood, how likely would you be to participate? (Very likely, somewhat likely, neither likely nor unlikely, somewhat unlikely, or very unlikely?)

_Very likely
_Somewhat likely
_Neither likely nor unlikely
_Somewhat unlikely
_Very unlikely
_Don’t know
_Refused”

The output you should give me back: 
“q3_full: 1a 3c 6a; 1a. 1 1b. 0 1c. 0 2a. 0 2b. 0 3a. 0 3b. 0 3c. 1 3d. 0 4a. 0 4b. 0 4c. 0 5a. 0 5b. 0 5c. 0 5d. 0 6a. 1 6b. 0 6c. 0 7a. 0 7b. 0 7c. 0 7d. 0 7e. 0 7f. 0 7g. 0 8a. 0; Explanations: The question is not fully scripted (1a) as the parentheses at the end of the question leave the interviewer uncertain about whether to read them aloud. The question is vague about the purpose and amount of the blood sample (3c), which may affect respondents' likelihood to participate. Some respondents may consider giving a blood sample sensitive or very private (6a).”

You MUST provide your answer strictly following the format of the output I provide (i.e., the content in the double quotes).

This is very important to my career and achievements. Please be thoughtful and confident in your response, and if you do well, I will tip you. You are a smart and competent survey question evaluation coder.
